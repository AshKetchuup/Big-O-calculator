# NEA
 
Big O calculator to calculate time complexity for C# code 
- Used Microsoft Code Analysis library extract tokens from syntax (like for loops, while and functions).
- Used parsing algorithms like Djikstra's Shunting Yard to solve and rearrange equations for the time complexity.
- Designed UI using WPF allowing users to input code and see results in real-time.
